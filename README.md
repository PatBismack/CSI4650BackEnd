# CSI4650BackEnd
by : Patrick, Ronveer, James, Donte, Gregory

## Overview
This project is an implementation of a server-client scheme for a voting system. This project aims to expand our knowledge on different implementations on how to build and deploy systems with different structures to handle a host of different types of problems
Our project uses the Gradle framework along with the previously mentioned server-client scheme to record votes of individuals on a prompt (polling question) with three possible responses (yes, no, abstain/null). We then will tally these votes and display them 
back to the users on a summary/report page.
